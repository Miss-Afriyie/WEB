        <h3 class="bme1"> ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING? </h3>
        <h3 class="coe1"> This Is a Little Something About Me</h3>
        <p> My name is Adwoa Afriyie Adjei-Twum, a student at Kwame Nkrumah University Of Science and Technology(KNUST) reading BSc. Biomedical Engineering. I also happen to be the vice course rep for my class.

        <p> I'm a young Christian girl in my late teens, eager to make a diffrence in my country and the world at large. I'm from the Ashanti Region of Ghana, West Africa. I had my basic school education at New Oxford International School. I then continued to pursue my high school education at Anglican Senior High School, Kumasi (KASS). I like movies, music, food, novels and sleep (but I get the job done first, just so you know).</p>
        <h3 class="coe1"> So, Why Biomed Engineering?</h3>
        <p>There's a little background story that inspired me to choose this path in life. Let's get to it. Some years ago, in my local congregation, there was a young lady who was also a family friend. Let's call her Miss R. So, Miss R was unfortunately diagnosed with kidney failure and both kidneys were removed, one after the other. All that was left was to put her on the dialysis machine. My dear Miss R was on the machine for about 4-5 years, which is a miracle, at least in my part of the world.</p>
        <p>  After a lot of complications and issues, she travelled abroad for further treatment. Very fortunately, early January this year, 2025, we heard good news from her and her husband that she had had a successful kidney transplant surgery. Glory be to God Almighty. </p> 
        <p> So long story short, I wondered about the dialysis machine and how it helped her. I mean, it kept her alive long enough for the kidney transplant.So, I researched about it and one thing led to another and it eventually led me to biomedical engineering. I then asked myself, "so if there was no biomedical engineer, countless people, including Miss R would and will die because there would be no machines or devices to detect, diagnose or treat diseases". I decided to follow that path to help save lives. I then looked further into the program.</p>
        <p> Realising that biomedical engineering was a combination of medicine and engineering, it peaked my interest more since I'm into computer stuff, working with machines vibes and saving lives basically. </p>
